# Course Overview & Syllabus

---

## Section 1: Course Information / "Start Here"

### Course Description:

    This course transitions students from writing code that "just works" to designing software that is scalable,
    maintainable, and robust. We will move beyond basic syntax to explore the SOLID principles and the standard Gang of
    Four (GoF) Design Patterns. The focus is on practical application: learning when to use a pattern to solve a 
    specific architectural problem (like tight coupling or spaghetti code) and, equally important, when not to use them.

### Meeting Times & Location:

- **Time:**  Tuesdays and Thursdays, 08:30 – 09:45
- **Location:** D118

### Instructor Information:

- **Instructor:** Elvin Taghizade
- **Email:** etaghizada@ada.edu.az
- **Office Hours:** Online via Microsoft Teams (By appointment).
- **Communication:** Please use email for all official communication.

### Prerequisites:

- Solid Java Programming skills are required.
- Understanding of algorithms and data structures is an advantage.

### Co-requisites:

- _"Object-Oriented Analysis & Design"_ is a co-requisite for this course but is recommended to take before attending
  _"Software Design & Patterns"_ course.

## Section 2: Syllabus & Grading

### Assessment Breakdown:

Students will be graded on an absolute scale based on the following components:

- **Participation & Activity `(10%)`:** Active engagement in lectures and discussions.
- **In-Class Quizzes `(15%)`:** Short, auto-graded quizzes held at the start of class to verify understanding of the
  Lab assignments and readings.
- **Lab Assignments `(20%)`:** Practical coding assignments submitted via GitHub. These are graded on completion and
  adherence to the design patterns.
- **Midterm Exam `(25%)`:** Written examination covering Principles and Patterns (Weeks 1–7). Tentatively scheduled for
  March 10.
- **Final Capstone Project or Exam `(30%)`:** A semester-end capstone project demonstrating system design capabilities,
  or a final exam (at instructor discretion).

### Attendance Policy:

- Attendance is `mandatory`.
- In compliance with Azerbaijani legislation, students who fail to attend `at least 75%` of classes will automatically
  fail the course (Receive FX).
- Attendance is checked during the `first 5 minutes`.

### Late Policy:

- Late submission of any assignment will be penalized by 25% per day of delay.
